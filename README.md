Howto get a better UX with Steamdeck's Gamescope

Gamescope has an unfinished Controller Configuration. But the Configuration can't be edited with the grafical interface.
Here are the Configuration files I updated manually for my Steamdeck and Steam Controller.
With this you can navigate with DPad, Left Stick or Right Stick. Also Mouse on the Right Pad with Scroll Wheel on the Left Pad is supported.

INSTALLATION:

copy "basicui.vdf" and "basicui_neptune.vdf" to "~/.local/share/Steam/userdata/[Your Steam User NUmber]/config/controller_configs/"

Example:

    cp basicui*.vdf ~/.local/share/Steam/userdata/12345678/config/controller_configs/

HAVE FUN!
